# CandidateV Project Status

## API Service Layer: 100% Complete âœ…

The API service layer provides a robust interface between the frontend and backend services:

- **apiClient.js**: Base configuration with interceptors for auth and error handling
- **config.js**: Environment-specific configuration settings
- **utils.js**: Utility functions for retry, batching, and error formatting
- **authService.js**: Authentication and user management
- **userService.js**: User profile operations
- **cvService.js**: CV template and content management
- **exportService.js**: CV export functionality
- **aiService.js**: AI-powered CV improvements
- **paymentService.js**: Subscription and payment management

## Enhanced Features Added

- âœ… Environment-aware configuration
- âœ… Advanced error handling and formatting
- âœ… Request/response logging for development
- âœ… API call retry with exponential backoff
- âœ… Batch request handling with concurrency control
- âœ… Custom useApi hook for simplified API usage

## New Components Added

- âœ… **CVDashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for CV management
- âœ… **CVList**: Component using the useApi hook for cleaner API usage
- âœ… **ProfilePage**: User profile management with form handling and useApi hook
- âœ… **PreferencesPage**: User preferences management with useApi hook

## Overall Project Completion: 85% ðŸ”„

The API service layer has been enhanced with advanced features and integrated into multiple functional components. We've successfully implemented:

1. A comprehensive API service layer with environment configuration, advanced error handling, and utilities
2. A custom useApi hook for simplified API integration in components
3. Multiple components showcasing real-world usage of the API layer:
   - CV Dashboard
   - CV List
   - User Profile Management
   - User Preferences Management

The remaining work is focused on updating the auth flow components to use the new API structure and completing the remaining backend services.

## Next Steps:

1. Complete backend API implementations (Auth, AI, Payment services)
2. Update auth flow components to use new useApi hook
3. Complete end-to-end testing
4. Add final polish and optimizations
5. Deploy to production environments
