## Test Coverage Requirements
- Target: 90% coverage
- Current Coverage: TBD (need to run coverage report)

## Notes
- All tests should use test database
- Mocked external services where appropriate
- End-to-end tests need to be added
- Contract tests need to be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Add contract tests
2. Add end-to-end tests
3. Run and verify coverage report
