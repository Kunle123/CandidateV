# Authentication Module Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step process for rebuilding the authentication module from scratch, based on the new architecture design.

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Create new branch for auth module rebuild
- [ ] Set up project structure according to new architecture
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up testing framework

### 1.2 Core Backend Components
- [ ] Implement configuration management (core/config.py)
- [ ] Create database models (db/models.py)
- [ ] Set up database migrations
- [ ] Implement security utilities (core/security.py)
- [ ] Create custom exceptions (core/exceptions.py)

### 1.3 Core Frontend Components
- [ ] Create token service (tokenService.js)
- [ ] Set up basic auth context structure (AuthContext.jsx)
- [ ] Implement auth types definitions (AuthTypes.js)

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation (Week 2)

### 2.1 Authentication Services
- [ ] Implement user service (services/user_service.py)
- [ ] Implement authentication service (services/auth_service.py)
- [ ] Create schemas for requests/responses (schemas/)
- [ ] Set up database session management (db/session.py)

### 2.2 API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement registration endpoint (api/auth.py)
- [ ] Implement login endpoint (api/auth.py)
- [ ] Implement token refresh endpoint (api/auth.py)
- [ ] Implement logout endpoint (api/auth.py)
- [ ] Create health check endpoints (api/health.py)

### 2.3 Backend Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for services
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up CI pipeline for automated testing

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Week 3)

### 3.1 Authentication Service
- [ ] Implement auth service API client (authService.js)
- [ ] Create authentication hooks (useAuth.js)
- [ ] Implement complete auth context provider (AuthContext.jsx)

### 3.2 Authentication Components
- [ ] Create login form component (LoginForm.jsx)
- [ ] Create registration form component (RegisterForm.jsx)
- [ ] Implement protected route component (ProtectedRoute.jsx)
- [ ] Create auth layout component (AuthLayout.jsx)

### 3.3 Frontend Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for auth service
- [ ] Write component tests for auth components
- [ ] Create integration tests for auth flows

## Phase 4: Integration and Migration (Week 4)

### 4.1 Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend services
- [ ] Implement compatibility layer for existing components
- [ ] Update API client configuration
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow

### 4.2 Migration
- [ ] Create migration guide for other developers
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Identify components using old auth system
- [ ] Plan gradual migration of dependent components

### 4.3 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Update environment variable documentation
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Prepare rollback strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring for auth-related issues

## Phase 5: Deployment and Cleanup (Week 5)

### 5.1 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy new auth system alongside existing one
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Gradually switch components to new system
- [ ] Validate all auth flows in production

### 5.2 Cleanup
- [ ] Remove old auth implementation
- [ ] Remove compatibility layer
- [ ] Clean up deprecated code
- [ ] Update documentation

### 5.3 Final Review
- [ ] Conduct security review
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User experience testing
- [ ] Documentation review

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Automate testing in CI pipeline

### Code Quality
- Use consistent coding style
- Implement code reviews for all changes
- Document all components and functions
- Use type hints/TypeScript where possible

### Security Focus
- Regular security reviews
- Follow OWASP authentication best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure defaults

## Dependencies and Resources

### Backend Dependencies
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- PyJWT
- Passlib/bcrypt
- Alembic (for migrations)

### Frontend Dependencies
- React (Context API)
- JWT-decode
- Axios or fetch API
- React Router (for protected routes)

### Development Resources
- 2 backend developers
- 2 frontend developers
- 1 QA engineer
- DevOps support for deployment

## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1
- Complete project setup
- Implement core backend components
- Set up basic frontend structure

### Week 2
- Complete backend implementation
- Pass all backend tests
- API documentation ready

### Week 3
- Complete frontend implementation
- Pass all frontend tests
- End-to-end testing of auth flows

### Week 4
- Integration complete
- Migration plan executed
- Deployment preparation finished

### Week 5
- Production deployment
- Cleanup completed
- Final review and documentation

## Success Criteria

1. All authentication flows work correctly
2. Security vulnerabilities addressed
3. Code is well-documented and maintainable
4. High test coverage (>90%)
5. Smooth user experience with no disruption during migration
6. Performance improvements over previous implementation
7. Clear separation of concerns in the new architecture
