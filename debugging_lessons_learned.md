# Debugging Lessons Learned: Microservices Architecture

## Docker and Container Issues

1. **Memory Limitations**
   - Split dependency installations into smaller chunks to avoid memory errors during builds
   - Prefer incremental installations grouped by related packages

2. **File Structure**
   - Ensure proper file paths in COPY commands
   - Use explicit paths (`./file`) instead of implicit ones (`file`)

3. **Dockerfile Best Practices**
   - Always include a proper `FROM` statement at the beginning
   - Explicitly install all dependencies to avoid missing packages
   - Run basic verification commands to check installations
   - Use multi-stage builds for complex applications

## Deployment Configuration

1. **Railway Deployments**
   - Use `DOCKERFILE` builder explicitly in railway.json when using custom Dockerfiles
   - Remove database migration commands from initial deployments to reduce complexity
   - Set a proper health check endpoint with reasonable timeout and retries
   - Configure appropriate restart policies

2. **Vercel Deployments**
   - Set the explicit VERCEL environment variable for conditional logic
   - Export modules correctly for serverless functions
   - Disable operations that don't work well in serverless (file system writes)
   - Create proper vercel.json configurations specifying builds and routes

## Microservices Communication

1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Configure CORS correctly on all services with appropriate origins
   - Test CORS with the actual frontend domain
   - Include trailing slash variations in CORS configs

2. **API Gateway Best Practices**
   - Implement robust error handling when services are unavailable
   - Track service availability status
   - Return proper status codes (503 instead of 500) for unavailable services
   - Include diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting

## Error Handling and Debugging

1. **Application Structure**
   - Use standalone files to simplify module imports
   - Create self-contained applications for easier deployment
   - Implement clear error boundaries between services

2. **Logging Strategy**
   - Set up environment-specific logging (simplified for serverless)
   - Use request IDs to track requests across services
   - Include timestamps, service names, and error details in logs
   - Add debug endpoints in production for diagnostic information

3. **Fallback Behavior**
   - Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable
   - Use mock data or stubs for testing before all services are ready

## Testing Approach

1. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each service in isolation before integration
   - Verify connectivity using health checks before full testing
   - Create comprehensive smoke tests for each deployment

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Double-check environment variable configuration in each deployment
   - Use defaults that make sense for the environment
   - Include environment-specific configuration for testing

## General Patterns

1. **Avoid Magic Paths**
   - Don't rely on directory structures that might change between environments
   - Use absolute module imports and avoid relative paths when possible

2. **Early Validation**
   - Add validation steps early in the deployment process
   - Return helpful error messages that explain what's missing

3. **Incremental Development**
   - Complete one component fully before moving to the next
   - Deploy services incrementally and verify each before proceeding
